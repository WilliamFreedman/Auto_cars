This is the code for my submition to the New York Enginerring Competition (NYEC). 
My project focused on the ways in which self driving cars can share information with eachother to increase safety and efficiency.
I also had to give a presentation to a panel of judges and submit a research proposal, both of which are attached below.
I won second place in the competition and received the award for innovation in transportation.
